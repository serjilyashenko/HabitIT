# HabitIT
Simple habit tracker for myself

This is a project I'm going to build while drinking a cup of coffee ☕️

https://habitit.netlify.app

#### Stack:
* Vite.js
* React
* Prettier
* Jest
* Testing Library
* Babel(only for Jest+React config)

**Notes:**
* LocalStorage persist habits
* Keeps all history in LS
