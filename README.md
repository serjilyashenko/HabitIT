# HabitIT

Simple habit tracker for myself

This is a project I'm going to build while drinking a cup of coffee ☕️

https://habitit.netlify.app

#### Stack:

- Vite.js
- React
- Prettier
- ESlint
- Jest
- Testing Library
- Babel(only for Jest+React config)
- LintStaged
- git-hooks

**Notes:**

- LocalStorage persist habits
- Keeps all history in LS
- Include Migrations of LS
- Always in local timezone (without z of isoString)
- Tests are started before build
